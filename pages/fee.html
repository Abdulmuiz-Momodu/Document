            <p>
                We recognise that the level of professional fee is an important factor in the selection of 
                your advisors. Our objective is to set our fees on a realistic and fair basis that responds 
                to your expectations. For the reasons explained in our approach, we believe our investment 
                in our people and methodology enables us to deliver the highest quality of advice and service 
                at a competitive fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our fees are based on the amount of time required at various levels of responsibility, plus 
                actual out-of-pocket expenses. Individual hourly rates vary according to the degree of 
                responsibility involved and the experience and skill required. This will be determined 
                based on the number of location to be visited, projects and the scope of work involve.
