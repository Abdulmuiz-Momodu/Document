            <p>
                Every good product starts with a good and simplified concept, diligent studies, planning, 
                resilience and commitment. This axiom is the bane of our beginning which we continue to 
                build upon. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In A – R IZUAGIE & CO, we endeavour to understand our clients and prospective clients
                in terms of nature of business, business environment, human and material resources, 
                external factors, their processes, their records, their peculiarities, and their needs 
                and expectations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goals in earnest is to exceed our client’s expectations. This concept blend with modern 
                scientific tools and highly trained and motivated personnel are the basis of our risk 
                base-approach to issues. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We ensure that personnel with requisite knowledge and skills are deployed on every engagement 
                we handle. This helps us to ensure that we always live up to our slogan, i.e. ‘meeting client’s 
                expectation is the minimum’
            </p>
            <p>
                We shall review the scope of our work with the appropriate college delegate at commencement of 
                work and use the same avenue to obtain their input on our detailed review program. We shall 
                identify the key contact personnel and desk officers and to give regular update of progress 
                of work through a mix of oral and written communications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our integrated audit approach is risk focused and based on the simple premise of providing 
                solutions that improve controls and add value.
